Bluboo Picasso 4G Rooting
=========================

Author: Ori Novanda (cargmax-at-gmail.com)

This repository contains a hand-cooked (manually) boot image for the Bluboo Picasso 4G Android phone.
I modified the boot image to contain the required files to gain root access on the phone without using TWRP/CWM or any third-party rooting program.
The phone will be rooted just by using this boot image file.

Steps to root to phone
----------------------
1. Get/Download SP Flash Tool from spflashtool.com (Windows/Linux)
2. Run SP Flash Tool
3. Load the scatter file
4. Load the boot image file (click the "location" cell of the "boot" row/partition)
5. Click "Download" button
6. Plug the USB cable into the phone (the phone should should be turned off prior to this)
7. Wait for the write/download process to complete (in seconds)
8. Unplug the USB cable
9. Power on the phone
10. Install SuperSU on the phone (either by sideloading or using Google Play)
11. Done, the phone should be rooted now!
