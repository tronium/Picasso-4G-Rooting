Bluboo Picasso 4G Rooting
=========================

Author: Ori Novanda (cargmax-at-gmail.com)

This repository contains several hand-cooked (manually) boot images for the Bluboo Picasso 4G Android phones.
I modified the boot images to contain the required files to gain root access on the phone without using TWRP/CWM or any third-party rooting program.
The phone will be rooted just by using one of these boot images that matches the phone.

This video shows the result of a rooted Bluboo Picasso 4G Android phone:
